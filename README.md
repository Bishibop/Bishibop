### Hello!

My name is Nicholas Mullen. I write code to improve software companies' marketing and sales efforts. Think of things like complex lead scoring, custom CRM workflow automations, technical product demos and web applications to increase lead acquisition. 

My favorite tools are JavaScript, React, Python, Mathematica, SQLite, AWS Lambda, and a paper notebook.

Outside of software, I enjoy playing [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/bishibop) and making bonsai trees to add to my ever-growing collection of houseplants.
